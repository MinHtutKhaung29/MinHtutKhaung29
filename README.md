# Hi, I’m Min Htut Khaung — Future Software Engineer & AI Builder

I’m a passionate programmer in Tokyo, Japan, learning Python and software development with big dreams:  
**To build powerful tools, solve global problems, and become a world-class engineer.**

## 🚀 My Journey So Far
- Currently studying **software programming** and **Japanese** to enter a top university in Japan
- Learning **Python** — my first language — step by step with real projects
- Interested in **AI, robotics, automation, and smart tools**
- Documenting everything I learn in my [Python Learning Journey Repo](https://github.com/MinHtutKhaung29/python-learning-journey)

## 🛠️ Tech I’m Learning
- Python (Core, OOP, Projects)
- Git & GitHub (Version control)
- HTML/CSS (Basics for future web projects)
- Japanese (Yes — even code needs culture)

## 🔧 Current Projects
- `python-learning-journey`: My weekly progress as a Python beginner
- `todo-cli`: A simple to-do app in the terminal
- `paiza-stats-visualizer`: A fun app to track Paiza learning progress (idea stage)
